    title: "Look Through the Tube",
    rules: "The adult points to an item (for example, a vase) for the child to observe. The adult asks the child to frame the item by looking through the tube.",
    learning: "Through this game, the child learns that to frame an object within the tube, one either needs to move closer to or further away from the object. This game underscores the idea that perception is influenced by one's viewpoint, which in turn, affects the size of the objects being observed. Objects appear smaller the further away they are.",
    alternative: "Instead of pointing to a fixed object, hold a pen and move it to different spots around the room. Switch roles so the child moves the pen while the adult tries to frame it through the tube.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "What's in the Bag?",
    rules: "The adult shows the child three items and then places them into a bag. The adult names one item, and the child needs to find the item from the bag using only the sense of touch.",
    learning: "When we draw, we aim to capture not just how something looks but also how it feels—whether it's hard, soft, rough, or smooth. This is sometimes called 'haptic vision,' where what we see feels almost touchable. This game is a fun way to connect our sense of touch with how we see shapes and textures.",
    alternative: "Taking turns... Now the child hides the items in the bag and asks the adult to find one. Try drawing one of the items on paper.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Shade of Grey",
    rules: "The adult draws a patch in a specific shade of grey, using even pressure. The child tries to match the same shade using a pencil.",
    learning: "This game introduces greyscale and how light and shadow effect drawing. It's a simple way to explore 'shade constancy'—how we see shades differently based on light and surroundings. The aim is to keep it fun and stress-free, focusing on learning and enjoyment, not perfection.",
    alternative: "Advanced learners can use software like Photoshop to check grey tone accuracy. Or, try drawing the shadow of an object cast on a table for variation.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    title: "Colour Match",
    rules: "The adult colours a square with one colour. The child should guess the colour by colouring another square with the matching colour.",
    learning: "This game teaches key skills in color theory and mixing. Children learn to understand hue, light, and chroma, and to mix colors accurately. They also discover how to avoid over-mixing, which can lead to unwanted grey tones. This hands-on exercise builds essential skills in color blending for future painting.",
    alternative: "Try using watercolors. The adult mixes two colors out of the child's sight (a little peeking is fine). The child then tries to recreate the same color by mixing their own.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    title: "How Far Is It?",
    rules: "The adult places two objects at a certain distance from each other. The adult asks the child to estimate the distance between the two objects in either centimeters or steps.",
    learning: "This exercise helps children develop spatial awareness and basic measurement skills, encouraging them to think about distance and space in quantitative terms, which improves their ability to create balanced and realistic sense of scale in their drawings.",
    alternative: "Switch roles: after the child estimates, let them place the objects and have the adult guess the distance. Or, try estimating distances of objects seen from a window.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    title: "Holding Items",
    rules: "The adult asks the child to identify which of two objects is closer. The adult then changes the objects' positions by moving them up and down and repeats the question.",
    learning: "This exercise helps children explore perspective and overlapping in their drawings, essential skills for showing depth and spatial relationships. When one object overlaps another, it indicates which is closer, enhancing their understanding of positioning in life drawing.",
    alternative: "When objects overlap, ask the child why one seems behind the other. Add a third object on the floor to explore more complex arrangements and perspectives.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    title: "Shadow Shapes",
    rules: "In a dimly lit room, the adult shines a flashlight on an object to cast its shadow on the wall or paper. The child observes the shadow and guesses the object creating it.",
    learning: "This exercise teaches the basics of light and shadow, showing how distance and angle change shadow size and shape. It encourages creativity in interpreting shadow shapes, and the shadow storytelling option builds narrative skills and creative expression.",
    alternative: "Create a story or scene using different object shadows to boost creativity and storytelling. Trace and color the shadows on paper to turn it into an art activity.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    title: "Points and Lines",
    rules: "The adult draws two points on the paper. The child tries to join the two points with a line, aiming for it to be as straight as possible.",
    learning: "This exercise teaches the child to hold the pencil correctly for precise drawing, making both the tip and stroke path visible. It improves visual-motor coordination as the child aligns their vision with hand movements, and introduces basic geometry concepts like straight lines and point relationships.",
    alternative: "Connect three points, then four, and so on, increasing the complexity of the lines and shapes formed.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    title: "Framing",
    rules: "The adult asks the child, 'What do you see through the frame?' The child describes what they see within the frame. Switch roles: The child holds the frame and has the adult describe what they see.",
    learning: "This game introduces framing and composition in visual arts. It teaches different perspectives, both physically and conceptually, by helping the child understand what others see. It also builds spatial skills as the child learns to interpret and adjust objects within the frame.",
    alternative: "Recognise and use frames present in everyday life, such as train windows, car windows, or house windows, to frame different scenes and objects.",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    title: "Guess What I Draw",
    rules: "The adult draws an object they see in the room. The child then has to guess what object it is by pointing to it in the room. Alternate turns between the adult and the child, with one drawing and the other guessing.",
    learning: "This game builds confidence in drawing real objects, helping participants accept that drawings don't need to be perfect. It also reduces shyness about drawing in front of others and improves observational skills by translating real objects onto paper, no matter the skill level.",
    alternative: "Instead of objects in the room, draw objects that are visible outside the window.",
  }
